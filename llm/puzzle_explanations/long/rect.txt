 You have a grid of squares, with numbers written in some (but not all) of the squares. Your task is to subdivide the grid into rectangles of various sizes, such that (a) every rectangle contains exactly one numbered square, and (b) the area of each rectangle is equal to the number written in its numbered square.

Credit for this game goes to the Japanese puzzle magazine Nikoli [3]; I've also seen a Palm implementation at Puzzle Palace [4]. Unlike Puzzle Palace's implementation, my version automatically generates random grids of any size you like. The quality of puzzle design is therefore not quite as good as hand-crafted puzzles would be, but on the plus side you get an inexhaustible supply of puzzles tailored to your own specification.

This game is played with the mouse or cursor keys.

Left-click any edge to toggle it on or off, or left-click and drag to draw an entire rectangle (or line) on the grid in one go (removing any existing edges within that rectangle). Right-clicking and dragging will allow you to erase the contents of a rectangle without affecting its edges.

Alternatively, use the cursor keys to move the position indicator around the board. Pressing the return key then allows you to use the cursor keys to drag a rectangle out from that position, and pressing the return key again completes the rectangle. Using the space bar instead of the return key allows you to erase the contents of a rectangle without affecting its edges, as above. Pressing escape cancels a drag.

When a rectangle of the correct size is completed, it will be shaded.
