You are given a number of points, some of which have lines drawn between them. You can move the points about arbitrarily; your aim is to position the points so that no line crosses another.

I originally saw this in the form of a Flash game called Planarity [7], written by John Tantalo.

To move a point, click on it with the left mouse button and drag it into a new position.

The cursor keys may also be used to navigate amongst the points. Pressing the Enter key will toggle dragging the currently-highlighted point. Pressing Tab or Space will cycle through all the points.
