You are given a grid of squares, some of which are filled with train tracks. You need to complete the track from A to B so that the rows and columns contain the same number of track segments as are indicated in the clues to the top and right of the grid.

There are only straight and 90 degree curved rails, and the track may not cross itself.

Tracks was contributed to this collection by James Harvey.

 Left-clicking on an edge between two squares adds a track segment between the two squares. Right-clicking on an edge adds a cross on the edge, indicating no track is possible there.

Left-clicking in a square adds a colour indicator showing that you know the square must contain a track, even if you don't know which edges it crosses yet. Right-clicking in a square adds a cross indicating it contains no track segment.

Left- or right-dragging between squares allows you to lay a straight line of is-track or is-not-track indicators, useful for filling in rows or columns to match the clue.
