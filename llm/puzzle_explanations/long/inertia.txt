You are a small green ball sitting in a grid full of obstacles. Your aim is to collect all the gems without running into any mines.

You can move the ball in any orthogonal or diagonal direction. Once the ball starts moving, it will continue until something stops it. A wall directly in its path will stop it (but if it is moving diagonally, it will move through a diagonal gap between two other walls without stopping). Also, some of the squares are ‘stops’; when the ball moves on to a stop, it will stop moving no matter what direction it was going in. Gems do not stop the ball; it picks them up and keeps on going.

Running into a mine is fatal. Even if you picked up the last gem in the same move which then hit a mine, the game will count you as dead rather than victorious.

This game was originally implemented for Windows by Ben Olmstead [11], who was kind enough to release his source code on request so that it could be re-implemented for this collection.

You can move the ball in any of the eight directions using the numeric keypad. Alternatively, if you click the left mouse button on the grid, the ball will begin a move in the general direction of where you clicked.
