You have a grid of coloured squares, which you have to clear by highlighting contiguous regions of more than one coloured square; the larger the region you highlight, the more points you get (and the faster you clear the arena).

If you clear the grid you win. If you end up with nothing but single squares (i.e., there are no more clickable regions left) you lose.

Removing a region causes the rest of the grid to shuffle up: blocks that are suspended will fall down (first), and then empty columns are filled from the right.

Same Game was contributed to this collection by James Harvey.

This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse.

If you left-click an unselected region, it becomes selected (possibly clearing the current selection).

If you left-click the selected region, it will be removed (and the rest of the grid shuffled immediately).

If you right-click the selected region, it will be unselected.

The cursor keys move a cursor around the grid. Pressing the Space or Enter keys while the cursor is in an unselected region selects it; pressing Space or Enter again removes it as above.
